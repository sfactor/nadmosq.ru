deleteDomainRequest
=====================

Purpose
-------

Deletes a registered domain under reseller account.

In case of registered domains with status ACT, this will result in a deletion at the registry. Keep in mind that not all TLDs support reactivation option and when available, this option could be quite expensive.

Domains with status FAI can be deleted to get a refund of the paid amount.

Parameters
----------

==================== ===========
parameter            description
==================== ===========
domain               :doc:`Domain object </terms/Domain>` to be renewed
id                   Domain ID. Only required if there are two identical domains in your account (for example, in case of pre-registrations)
type                 Deletion type. Possible values: 'delete' and 'pushtoregistry' (push to registry is not a real deletion, but transfer to registry account. Allowed for .de and .at TLDs only)
==================== ===========
